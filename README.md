# bulls-cows
The game bulls &amp; cows
Here you are going to modify your Bulls & Cows game to use functions.

 

There should be one overall function, bulls_and_cows, that will play then game when run.

 

The function should also have sub functions:

 

i. generate_computer_vector should generate the computer vector. 

 

ii. get_guess should prompt the user to input a guess, including telling the user how many guesses they have remaining.

 

iii. number_bulls_and_cows should calculate the number of bulls and cows, given a computer vector and a user guess. The function number_bulls_and_cows should itself call two sub-functions, number_bulls and number_cows.

 

iv. do_response should print the computerâ€™s response to the guess..
